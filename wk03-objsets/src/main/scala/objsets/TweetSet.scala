/**
	* This represents a set of objects of type `Tweet` in the form of a binary search
	* tree. Every branch in the tree has two children (two `TweetSet`s). There is an
	* invariant which always holds: for every branch `b`, all elements in the left
	* subtree are smaller than the tweet at `b`. The elements in the right subtree are
	* larger.
	*
	* Note that the above structure requires us to be able to compare two tweets (we
	* need to be able to say which of two tweets is larger, or if they are equal). In
	* this implementation, the equality / order of tweets is based on the tweet's text
	* (see `def incl`). Hence, a `TweetSet` could not contain two tweets with the same
	* text from different users.
	*
	*
	* The advantage of representing sets as binary search trees is that the elements
	* of the set can be found quickly. If you want to learn more you can take a look
	* at the Wikipedia page [1], but this is not necessary in order to solve this
	* assignment.
